# Build a secure Swarm cluster

In this section, we’ll build a secure swarm cluster with three *manager nodes* and three
*worker nodes*:

If you think you hit networking issues, be sure the following ports are open between all swarm nodes:
  - *2377/tcp*: for secure client-to-swarm communication  
  - *7946/tcp* and *udp*: for control plane gossip  
  - *4789/udp*: for VXLAN-based overlay networks  

## Initializing a new swarm  
The process of building a swarm is called *initializing a swarm*, and the high-level process is this: Initialize the first manager node > Join additional manager nodes > Join worker nodes > Done.  

Docker nodes that are not part of a swarm are said to be in **single-engine mode**. Once they’re added to a swarm they’re automatically switted into **swarm mode**.  

Running `docker swarm init` on a Docker host in single-engine mode will switch that node into *swarm mode*, create a new swarm, and make the node the first *manager* of the swarm. Additional nodes can then be joined to the swarm as workers and managers.  

**Note**: If the datetime of your host did not set, you must set correct timezone before starting following steps (Guide: https://orcacore.com/set-up-time-synchronization-debian-12-bookworm/)  

The following steps will initialize a new swarm:  

1. Log on to swarm-manager-01 and initialize a new swarm.  
    ```
    swarm-manager-01:~# docker swarm init \
        --advertise-addr 172.16.188.11:2377 \
        --listen-addr 172.16.188.11:2377
    Swarm initialized: current node (d0psdx1wo3jt5vk7lgrmrlksv) is now a manager.
    <Snip>
    ```

    The command can be broken down as follows:  

      -  `docker swarm init`: This tells Docker to initialize a new swarm and make this node the first manager. It also puts the node into *swarm mode*.  
      - `--advertise-addr`: This is the swarm API endpoint that will be advertised to other managers and workers. It will usually be one of the node’s IP addresses but can be an external load-balancer address. It’s an optional flag unless you need to specify a load-balancer or specific IP on a node with multiple IPs.  
      - `--listen-addr`: This is the IP address that the node will accept swarm traffic on. If you don’t set it, it defaults to the same value as `--advertise-addr`. If `--advertise-addr` is a load-balancer, you **must** use `--listen-addr` to specify a local IP or interface for swarm traffic.  

    **Note**: For production environments I recommend you be specific and always use both flags. It’s not so important for lab environments like ours.  

    The default port that Swarm mode operates on is **2377**. This is customizable, but it’s convention to use *2377/tcp* for secured (HTTPS) client-to-swarm connections.  

2. List the nodes in the swarm.  
    ```
    swarm-manager-01:~# docker node ls
    ID              HOSTNAME           STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
    dps...rlksv *   swarm-manager-01   Ready     Active         Leader           26.0.0
    
    ```

3. From swarm-manager-01 run the `docker swarm join-token` command to extract the commands and tokens required to add new workers and managers to the swarm.  
    ```
    swarm-manager-01:~# docker swarm join-token worker 
    To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
    
        docker swarm join --token  SWMTKN-1-0uahebax...c87tu8dx2c 172.16.188.11:2377

    
    swarm-manager-01:~# docker swarm join-token manager 
    To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command:
    
        docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-0uahebax...ue4hv6ps3p 172.16.188.11:2377
    ```  

    **Note**: Notice that the commands to join workers and managers are identical apart from the join tokens (SWMTKN...). This means that whether a node joins as a worker or a manager depends entirely on which token you use when joining it. **You should keep your join tokens in a safe place as they’re the only thing required to join a node to a swarm!**  


4. Log on to swarm-worker-01 and join it to the swarm using the `docker swarm join` command with the worker join token.  
    ```
    swarm-worker-01:~# docker swarm join \
        --token SWMTKN-1-0uahebax...c87tu8dx2c 172.16.188.11:2377 \
        --advertise-addr 172.16.188.21:2377 \
        --listen-addr 172.16.188.21:2377
    
    This node joined a swarm as a worker.
    ```  

    The `--advertise-addr`, and `--listen-addr` flags are optional. I’ve added them as I consider it best practice to be as specific as possible when it comes to network configuration in production environments. You probably don’t need them just for a lab.  

5. Repeat the previous step on swarm-worker-02 and swarm-worker-03 so that they join the swarm as workers. If you’re specifying the *--advertise-addr* and *--listen-addr* flags, make sure you use swarm-worker-02 and swarm-worker-03’s respective IP addresses.  

6. Log on to swarm-manager-02 and join it to the swarm as a manager using the `docker swarm join` command with the manager join token.  
    ```
    swarm-manager-02:~# docker swarm join \
        --token SWMTKN-1-0uahebax...ue4hv6ps3p 172.16.188.11:2377 \
        --advertise-addr 172.16.188.12:2377 \
        --listen-addr 172.16.188.12:2377
    
    This node joined a swarm as a manager.
    ```

7. Repeat the previous step on swarm-manager-03, remembering to use swarm-manager-03’s IP address for the *--advertise-addr* and *--listen-addr* flags.

8. List the nodes in the swarm by running `docker node ls` from any of the manager nodes.  
    ```
    swarm-manager-01:~# docker node ls
    ID                HOSTNAME           STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
    0g4rl...babl8     swarm-manager-01   Ready     Active         Leader           26.0.0
    d21ly...9qzkx *   swarm-manager-02   Ready     Active         Reachable        26.0.0
    2xlti...l0nyp     swarm-manager-03   Ready     Active         Reachable        26.0.0
    8yv0b...wmr67     swarm-worker-01    Ready     Active                          26.0.0
    9mzwf...e4m4n     swarm-worker-02    Ready     Active                          26.0.0
    e62gf...l5wt6     swarm-worker-03    Ready     Active                          26.0.0
    ```

Congratulations. You’ve just created a 6-node swarm with 3 managers and 3 workers. As part of the process, the Docker Engine on each node was automatically put into *swarm mode* and the swarm was automatically secured with TLS.  

**Note**: If you look in the *MANAGER STATUS* column you’ll see the three manager nodes are showing as either **Reachable** or **Leader**. Nodes with nothing in the *MANAGER STATUS* column are *workers*. Also the asterisk (*) after the ID tells you which node you’re executing commands from.  

Now that you have a swarm up and running, let’s take a look at manager high availability (HA).
