# Managing stacks
It’s possible to use the `docker service` command to manage services that are part of the stack. A simple example would be using the `docker service scale` command to increase the number of replicas in the web-fe service. However, using the command line like this is called the `imperative` method (making changes via the CLI and individual docker commands) and it’s **not the recommended method!**

The recommended method is the `declarative` method. This uses the **stack file** as the ultimate source of truth and demands that all changes be made by updating the stack file and redeploying the app from the updated file.

Let’s walk through the process of making a couple of declarative changes to the stack. We’ll make the following changes:
  - Increase the number of web-fe replicas from 4 to 10
  - Update the app based on a newer image called :swarm-appv2

</p>

Update the *compose.yaml* file to reflect the changes. The relevant sections should look like this:
```
<Snip>
services:
  web-fe:
  image: nigelpoulton/ddd-book:swarm-appv2     <<---- changed to swarm-appv2
  command: python app.py
  deploy:
    replicas: 4                                <<---- Changed from 4 to 10
    <Snip>
```

Save the file and redeploy the app.
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker stack deploy -c compose.yaml ddd
Updating service ddd_web-fe (id: pe0qjp9a75w0f21j9veqr2mhc)
Updating service ddd_redis (id: s48rmgreclofbypnc4tr4vmtg)
```

Re-deploying the app like this will only update the changed components. Run a `docker stack ps` to see the progress of the update.
```
swarm-manager-01:# docker stack ps ddd

```

Two things happened when we re-deployed the stack:
  - The web-fe service was scaled up from 4 replicas to 10
  - The web-fe service was changed to use the *swarm-appv2* image

Scaling up from 4 - 10 added 6 new replicas. These will be deployed with the new image version. The existing 4 replicas will also *be deleted and replaced with new ones* running the new version. This is because Docker treats replicas as immutable objects and **never makes changes to live replicas** – it always deletes existing replicas and replaces them with new ones.

Also, the process of updating the 4 existing replicas follows the update rules defined in the Compose file — update two replicas, wait 10 seconds, update the other 2, wait 10 seconds... If any issues occur, the swarm will attempt a rollback to the previous configuration.
```
web-fe:
  deploy:
    update_config:
      parallelism: 2
      delay: 10s
      failure_action:rollback
```
Check the update worked by refreshing your browser.

The correct way to delete a stack is with the `docker stack rm` command. Be warned though! It deletes the stack without asking for confirmation.
```
swarm-manager-01:# docker stack rm ddd
Removing service ddd_redis
Removing service ddd_web-fe
Removing network ddd_counter-net
```

**Note:** Notice that the network and services were deleted but the volume wasn’t. This is because volumes are long-term persistent data stores and exist independent of the lifecycle of containers, services, and stacks.

Congratulations. You know how to deploy and manage a multi-service app using
Docker Stacks.
