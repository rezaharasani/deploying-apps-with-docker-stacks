# Swarm primer  

On the clustering front, a swarm consists of one or more Docker **nodes**. These *nodes* can be physical servers, VMs, Raspberry Pi’s, or cloud instances. The only requirement is that they all have Docker installed and can communicate over reliable networks.  

  **Terminology**: When referring to Docker Swarm we’ll write Swarm with an uppercase “S”. When referring to a swarm (cluster of nodes) we’ll use a lowercase “s”.

Nodes are configured as *managers* or *workers*. **Managers** look after the control plane, meaning things like the state of the cluster and dispatching tasks to workers. **Workers** accept tasks from managers and execute them.  

The configuration and state of the swarm is held in a distributed database replicated on all managers. It’s kept in-memory and is extremely up-to-date. However, the best thing is that it requires zero configuration — it’s installed as part of the swarm and just takes care of itself.  

*Swarm* uses TLS to encrypt communications, authenticate nodes, and authorize roles. Automatic key rotation is also thrown in as the icing on the cake.  

On the orchestration front, the atomic unit of scheduling on a swarm is the **service**. This is a high-level construct that wraps some advanced features around containers. These features include scaling, rolling updates, and simple rollbacks. It’s useful to think of a service as an enhanced container.
