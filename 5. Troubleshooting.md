# Troubleshooting
Swarm Service logs can be viewed with the `docker service logs` command. However, not all logging drivers
support the command.  

By default, Docker nodes configure services to use the json-file log driver, but other drivers exist, including:  
• journald (only works on Linux hosts running systemd)  
• syslog  
• splunk  
• gelf  

`json-file` and `journald` are the easiest to configure, and both work with the `docker service logs` command. The format of the command is `docker service logs <service-name>`.
