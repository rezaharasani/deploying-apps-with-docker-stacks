# Backing up Swarm
Backing up a swarm will backup the *control plane objects* required to recover the swarm in the event of a catastrophic failure of corruption. Recovering a swarm from a backup is an extremely rare scenario. However, business critical environments should always be prepared for worst-case scenarios.  

Swarm configuration and state is stored in `/var/lib/docker/swarm` on every manager node. The configuration includes; Raft log keys, overlay networks, Secrets, Configs, Services, and more. A swarm backup is a copy of all the files in this directory.  

As the contents of this directory are replicated to all managers, you can, and should, perform backups from multiple managers. However, as you have to stop the Docker daemon on the node you are backing up, it’s a good idea to perform the bachup from non-leader managers. This is because stopping Docker on the leader will initiate a leader election. You should also perform the backup at a quiet time for the business, as stopping a manager can increase the risk of the swarm losing quorum if another manager fails during the backup.  

**Warning**: The following operation carries risks. You should also ensure you perform test backup
and restore operations regularly and test the outcomes.  

The following commands will create the following two objects so you can prove the restore operation:  
• An overlay network called *Unimatrix-01*  
• A Secret called “missing drones” containing the text *Seven of Nine*  

```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker network create -d overlay Unimatrix-01
w9l904ff73e7stly0gnztsud7

swarm-manager-01:~# printf "Seven of Nine" | docker secret create missing_drones -
