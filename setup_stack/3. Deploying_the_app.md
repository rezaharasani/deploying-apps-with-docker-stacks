# Deploying the app
We’ll deploy the app as a Docker Stack. This means our Docker nodes need to be configured as a swarm.

## Building a lab for the sample app

1. Initialize a new Swarm.
   Run the following command on the node that you want to be the swarm manager.
   ```
   swarm-manager-01:~# docker swarm init \
     --advertise-addr 172.16.188.11:2377 \
     --listen-addr 172.16.188.11:2377
   Swarm initialized: current node (d0psdx1wo3jt5vk7lgrmrlksv) is now a manager.
   <Snip>
   ```
   
2. Add worker nodes.
   Copy the `docker swarm join` command that was output by the previous command. Paste it into the two nodes you want to join as workers.
   ```
   swarm-worker-01:~# docker swarm join \
      --token SWMTKN-1-0uahebax...c87tu8dx2c 172.16.188.11:2377 \
      --advertise-addr 172.16.188.21:2377 \
      --listen-addr 172.16.188.21:2377

   This node joined a swarm as a worker.

   swarm-worker-02:~# docker swarm join \
      --token SWMTKN-1-8gedsghy...h21uf8dw6t 172.16.188.11:2377 \
      --advertise-addr 172.16.188.22:2377 \
      --listen-addr 172.16.188.22:2377

   This node joined a swarm as a worker.
   ```

4. Verify that the Swarm is configured with one manager and two workers.
   Run this command from the manager node.
   ```
   swarm-manager-01:~# docker node ls
   ID                HOSTNAME           STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
   0g4rl...babl8 *   swarm-manager-01   Ready     Active         Leader           26.0.0
   8yv0b...wmr67     swarm-worker-01    Ready     Active                          26.0.0
   9mzwf...e4m4n     swarm-worker-02    Ready     Active                          26.0.0
   ```

The Swarm is now ready. Let’s deploy the stack.


## Deploying the sample app
Stacks are deployed using the `docker stack deploy` command. In its basic form it accepts two arguments:
  - name of the stack file
  - name of the stack


We’ll use the compose.yaml file in the swarm-app folder of the book’s GitHub repo and we’ll call the app ddd. Feel free to give yours a different name.

Run the following commands from *swarm-app* directory on the Swarm manager. If the manager doesn’t have a copy of the GitHub repo, clone it with this command.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nigelpoulton/ddd-book.git
```

Deploy the stack.
```
swarm-manager-01:# docker stack deploy -c compose.yaml ddd
Creating network ddd_counter-net
Creating service ddd_redis
Creating service ddd_web-fe
```
You can run `docker network ls`, `docker volume ls`, and `docker service ls` commands to see the networks, volumes, and services that were deployed as part of the app.

**Note:** The networks and volumes were created before the services. This is because services use these and will fail to start if they don’t exist.

Docker prefixes the name of the stack to every resource it creates. In our example, the stack is called ddd, meaning all resources are named `ddd_<resource>`.

You can verify the status of a stack with a couple of commands. `docker stack ls` lists very basic info on all stacks on the system. `docker stack ps <stack-name>` gives more detailed information about a specific stack. 
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker stack ls
NAME      SERVICES
ddd       2

swarm-manager-01:~# docker stack ps ddd 
ID             NAME           IMAGE               NODE              DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE
25dn1yfmrixk   ddd_redis.1    redis:alpine        swarm-worker-01   Running         Running 8 minutes ago

z2q93n5qzcx1   ddd_web-fe.2   nigel...swarm-app   swarm-worker-02   Running         Running 8 minutes ago             
nu205jjhwxxb   ddd_web-fe.3   nigel...swarm-app   swarm-worker-02   Running         Running 8 minutes ago             
i64yopl55vuo   ddd_web-fe.4   nigel...swarm-app   swarm-worker-01   Running         Running 8 minutes ago
```

The `docker stack ps` command is a good place to start when troubleshooting services that fail to start. It gives an overview of every service in the stack, including which node replicas are scheduled on, current state, desired state, and error messages.

Use the `docker service logs` command for more detailed logs. You pass it the **service name or ID**, or a **replica ID**. If you pass it the service name or ID, you’ll get the logs for all service replicas. If you pass it a particular replica ID, you’ll only get the logs for that replica.

The following example shows the logs for all replicas in the *ddd_web-fe* service.
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service logs --no-task-ids ddd_web-fe

```

You can follow the logs (`--follow`), tail them (`--tail`), and you may be able to get extra details (`--details`).

Point a browser at the app to verify it’s up and working. As it’s exposed on the swarm ingress on port 5001 you can point a browser to any cluster node on that port. If you’re on Docker Desktop you can use localhost:5001.

Now that the stack is up and running, let’s see how declaratively manage it.
