# Overview of the sample app

We’ll be using an application with two services, an encrypted overlay network, a volume, and a port mapping. The application architecture is shown in Figure.

**Terminology**: When referring to *services* we’re talking about the Docker service object that is one or more identical containers managed as a single object on a swarm cluster.

If you haven’t already done so, clone the book’s GitHub repo so that you have all of the application source files on your local machine.
```

Feel free to look at the application. However, we’ll be focussing on the *compose.yaml*
file. Sometimes we’ll refer to the Compose file as the `stack file`, and sometimes we’ll refer
to the application as the *stack*.

At the highest level, the Compose defines 3 top-level keys.
```
networks:
volumes:
services:
```

**Networks** defines the networks required by the app, **volumes** defines volumes, and
**services** is where you define the microservices that make up the app. The file is a simple
example of `infrastructure as code` — the application and its infrastructure is all defined in
a configuration that’s used to deploy and manage it.

If you expand each top-level key, you’ll see how things map to above Figure with one network, one volume, and two services.  
```
networks:
counter-net:
volumes:
counter-vol:
services:
web-fe:
redis:
```

The stack file is also a great source of documentation as it captures and defines most of the app.
