# Troubleshooting
Swarm Service logs can be viewed with the docker service logs command. However, not all logging drivers support it. 

By default, Docker nodes configure services to use the `json-file` log driver, but other drivers exist, including:  
• awslogs  
• gelf  
• gcplogs  
• journald (only works on Linux hosts running systemd)  
• splunk  
• syslog  

`json-file` and `journald` are the easiest to configure, and both work with the `docker service logs` command. The format of the command is `docker service logs <service-name>`.  

The following snippet from a `daemon.json` configuration file shows a Docker host configured to use `syslog`.  
```
{
  "log-driver": "syslog"
}
```

You can force individual services to use a different driver by passing the `--log-driver` and `--log-opts` flags to the `docker service create` command. These will override anything set in `daemon.json`.  
Service logs expect applications to run as **PID 1** and send logs to `STDOUT` and errors to `STDERR`. The logging driver forwards these logs to the locations configured via the logging driver.  

The following `docker service logs` command shows the logs for all replicas in the uber-svc service:  
```

Each line starts with the name of the replica, whi includes the service name, replica number, replica ID, and name of host that it’s scheduled on. Following that is the log output.  

You can follow the logs (`--follow`), tail them (`--tail`), and get extra details (`--details`).
