## Socker Swarm Structure
This is a book about Docker, no prior knowledge required. In fact, the motto of the book is Zero to Docker in a single book.  

So, if youâ€™re involved in the development and operations of cloud-native microservices apps and need to learn Docker, or if you want to be involved in that stuff, this book is dedicated to you.
